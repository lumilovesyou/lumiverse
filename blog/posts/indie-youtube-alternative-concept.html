                The other day I was thinking about what would happen when YouTube inevitably goes down. There would be so much history and content that would be lost forever with no way to recover. There's also no <em>real</em> YouTube alternatives to turn towards. Thinking on this more I've come up with an interesting idea for an alternative, though in all honesty it's likely not a realistic or very good one.<br><br>

                My idea is a central platform that would basically just act as the YouTube home page and subscriptions feed. You could find and search videos, channels, etc. Thing is, none of the actual videos would be hosted there. Instead all the videos would be hosted on individuals' own sites. Upon clicking a video it would be streamed from that user's server to you.<br><br>

                Obviously there's a lot of problems with the idea such as users being able to modify the content streamed easily, filtering would be difficult, a video going viral would basically DDOS someone's home server, etc. It's a cool idea on paper and might be neat for something like a small group of people making their own video platform. Beyond that it'd likely fall apart rather quickly.
